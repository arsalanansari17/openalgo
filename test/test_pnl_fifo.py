# test/test_pnl_fifo.py
"""Regression tests for utils/pnl_fifo.py's grouping key.

Bug found verifying P&L against a real account's Zerodha Tax P&L export
(SKYSHIELD_PATCHES.md): grouping by (symbol, exchange, product) treats a
cash-equity ISIN bought on NSE and sold on BSE as two unrelated positions,
producing phantom open positions and understated realized loss. Equity
must merge NSE/BSE by ISIN-equivalent symbol; F&O must not, since NFO/BFO
are genuinely different contracts.
